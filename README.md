# EcoTrip - sustainable travel planner

## üìÑ About The Project

EcoTrip is an interactive web application designed to help users make environmentally conscious travel choices by comparing the CO2 emissions of different modes of transportation‚Äîairplane, train, bus, and car. The goal is to encourage more sustainable travel decisions by providing clear and visualized data on emissions.

Users can input two cities they wish to travel between, and the application generates a bar chart comparing the CO2 emissions for each transportation option. Additionally, users have the flexibility to select two points on a Leaflet map, which will then calculate and display the same emission comparisons in a similar bar chart format.

The application is developed using React and TypeScript, ensuring a modern, responsive, and efficient user experience. By combining data visualization with interactive mapping, the project offers an engaging way for users to understand the environmental impact of their travel choices.
